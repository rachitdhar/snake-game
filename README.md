# snake-game
A recreation of the classic snake game. Written purely in C.

# Gameplay

- Use arrow keys to move around.
- For each food item the snake eats, one point is added to the score.
- The snake's length increases with each food item eaten.
- If the snake eats itself, or if it touches the boundary, it dies (and game over screen is displayed).
- Use spacebar to pause, or to restart after game over.
